# DS4420-final-project

Our data files were too large to commit to github so instead we suggest that you:

1. Download the zip from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_A9TBFodORZoELGmMuxf1L4L4BEIJ6PQ/view?usp=sharing).
2. Place in this directory and unzip

That's all! The preprocess_data.ipynb is simply a script we used to clean/filter our data, so it does not need to be rerun unless you want to be more strict/lax on the filters.
